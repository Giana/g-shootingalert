# G-ShootingAlert

G-ShootingAlert is a script for FiveM QBCore allowing you to notify police of shootings at configured locations.

This was requested by someone who does not use qb-policejob, so it may be useful to you if you also are not using qb-policejob. It uses the police alert code from qb-policejob so the alerts look/function the same.

<h1>INSTALLATION GUIDE</h1>

1. Drop the g-shootingalert folder into your [standalone] folder (or whichever other ensured folder you want to use)

<h1>FEATURES</h1>

- Create new locations to monitor for shootings and configure alert distance, text, and cooldown
- Deactivate locations from config without removing them
